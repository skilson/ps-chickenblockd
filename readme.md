Super rudimentary way to lookup matings for different chickens in Chicken Block'D as well track your progress.

![Sample Image](/img/sample.png?raw=true "Sample Image")

What this does:
* shows mating to create breed
* shows all matings the breed is part of
* track your collection/progress

Data for matings primarily came from [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ChickenBlock/comments/mbvxis/all_the_breeding_combos_ive_found_so_far_in/gsjqsum?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) with some small adjustments.

## How to Use

Run main.ps1 - you can do this multiple ways.

For simple Windows use you can download this repo, extract the zip (if compressed), and right click `main.ps1` and select `Run with PowerShell`

If you are running on MacOs/Linus you'll fix need to ensure you have Powershell Core installed. I'll include these steps later. Once you have it and have downloaded/extract this repo you can run it by executing `pwsh .\main.ps1` from the terminal running within the directory.
